In the command line interface (CLI), the **`ls`** and **`cat`** commands are commonly used to interact with files and directories.

### 1. **`ls` Command**
The **`ls`** command is used to **list the contents** of a directory. When you run `ls`, it shows the files and directories present in the current directory. You can also specify a different directory or use various options to modify the output.

#### Examples:
- `ls`: Lists the files and directories in the current directory.
- `ls /path/to/directory`: Lists the contents of the specified directory.
- `ls -l`: Lists the contents in long format, showing detailed information like permissions, ownership, size, and modification date.
- `ls -a`: Shows all files, including hidden files (those starting with a dot `.`).

### 2. **`cat` Command**
The **`cat`** command is used to **concatenate and display the content of files**. It's often used to view the contents of a file directly in the terminal.

#### Examples:
- `cat filename.txt`: Displays the contents of `filename.txt` in the terminal.
- `cat file1.txt file2.txt`: Concatenates and displays the contents of both `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` in sequence.
- `cat > newfile.txt`: Allows you to create a new file (`newfile.txt`) and type its contents directly into the terminal.

In summary:
- **`ls`** lists files and directories.
- **`cat`** displays the contents of files.
